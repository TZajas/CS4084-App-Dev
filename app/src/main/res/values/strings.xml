    <string name="safety_tip_1">1. Be aware of your surroundings: Its essential to be aware of your surroundings while on campus. Always be mindful of your surroundings and who is around you, especially when walking alone or in isolated areas. Avoid walking through dark or deserted areas, and try to stick to well-lit areas and busy paths where there are people around.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_2">2. Stay connected with others: Stay connected with friends or family members, and let them know your whereabouts, especially if youre going out at night or in isolated areas. You can also use safety apps that allow you to share your location with trusted contacts and send out an alert if you feel unsafe. Having a buddy system can also help you stay safe and look out for each other.</string>
    <string name="safety_tip_3">3. Learn self-defense techniques: Learning basic self-defense techniques can help you protect yourself in case of an attack. Consider taking a self-defense class or workshop to learn some techniques and strategies for defending yourself. These classes can teach you how to be aware of your surroundings, how to use your voice to deter attackers, and how to physically defend yourself if needed. Remember, the goal of self-defense is to create an opportunity for you to escape to safety, not to engage in a physical fight.</string>
